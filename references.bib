  title = {Norway's Fjord-Cooled Data Center},

  abstract = {The article: A small but growing number of data centers are slashing
	their cooling costs by using the environment as their chiller, tapping
	nearby rivers, underground lakes, wells and even the Baltic Sea.
	A new project in Norway plans to draw cold water from an adjacent
	fjord and use it to cool data halls.The Green Mountain Data Center
	is located on the shores of the island of Rennesoy, inside concrete
	buildings within caves carved out of the mountain. Racks of servers
	will now fill underground halls that once stored ammunition for NATO.The
	project is being developed by the investment arm of the Norwegian
	shipping firm Smedvig, which is working with a leading Nordic IT
	services firm, ErgoGroup, and electric utility Lyse Energi.The ability
	to use the fjord as a low-cost source for chilled water was a major
	advantage of the Rennesoy location. Green Mountain's cooling system
	taps the fjord for a steady supply of water at 8 degrees C (46 degrees
	F), which is optimal for use in data center cooling systems.Chilled
	water is a key component of many data center cooling systems. This
	water is often supplied by chillers, large refrigeration units that
	require a hefty amount of electricity to operate. Eliminating the
	chillers will usually allow a data center to operate with lower energy
	bills than similar facilities using chillers.The Green Mountain Data
	Center is being built out in two phases. The first phase is designed
	for traditional colocation space, and will include about 7,000 square
	meters (about 75,000 square feet) of data center space. Another 4,000
	square meters (43,000 square feet) will house data center container
	solutions, which will also use chilled water for cooling.The developers
	are in the late stages of negotiations with Norwegian clients, but
	believe the facility may be attractive to multi-nationals based in
	the U.S. and Europe. ``We are now mainly focusing on corporate customers
	with worldwide facilities who wish to reduce their carbon footprint
	across their portfolio of data centres, improve their `green credentials'
	and reduce spending on power,'' said Jonathan Evans of Green Mountain.The
	build-out of the colocation halls will begin in January, and the
	power to the facility is also being upgraded. Green Mountain expects
	the first clients to be installed in late 2012. Here's a video providing
	a conceptual overview of the project.},

  abstract = {Field investigations in the hydrologic sciences often are limited
	by the ability to collect data at the high spatiotemporal resolution
	necessary to build accurate predictive models or to control complex
	engineered systems in real time. Here, we describe LakeNet, an embedded
	wireless sensor network constructed by an interdisciplinary team
	of hydrogeologists, environmental engineers, and electrical engineers
	at the University of Notre Dame. Off-the-shelf temperature, dissolved
	oxygen, and pH probes are suspended from floating, waterproof cases
	with electronics, forming sensor pods. Wireless transmission to relay
	stations and a PC gateway enable researchers to interact with the
	network remotely to alter sampling patterns, download data, and analyze
	data trends using the gateway’s recursive processing of raw data.
	LakeNet functions as a “smart” network, in which each pod is aware
	of surrounding pods. Ongoing research will allow in-network computation
	to detect change points in the data stream, thus triggering altered
	sampling strategy in response to sensed events or individual probe/pod
	failure. This ability for the sensor network to alter sampling strategy
	can increase sensor shelf life, which will become more important
	as novel sensors are developed, and decrease system energy requirements.
	Initial deployment at St. Mary’s Lake on the Notre Dame campus in
	the fall of 2005 showed that temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen
	changes were consistent with diurnal fluctuations in sunlight, hence,
	photosynthesis. In describing LakeNet, we summarize current capabilities
	and ongoing research, including some of the challenges that need
	to be overcome for further sensor network development, widespread
	deployment, and maximum usefulness.},
